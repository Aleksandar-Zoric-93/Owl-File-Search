# Owl File Search
## Overview
This application is used to find a specific file or directory quickly via its search parameters.
Searching for a file and selecting it, the user can open the file location which highlights the selected file in explorer. 
The user has the option to add files to favorites for quick access.

This is useful for users with a large amount of files on their machine and wish to find the file quickly rather than searching via the explorer.

The application size is small and simple to install via the setup file included. Doing so will create a desktop shortcut for quick access.
